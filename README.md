# Flex

The Flex Programming Language

## Sample

```js
let myNumber = 12;

if myNumber >= 16 {
  print "Larger than 16";
} else {
  print "Smaller than 16";
}

fn addTwo num {
  return num + 2;
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];

for number in numbers {
	print addTwo number;
}
```

# Syntax

### Variable Declaration

```js
let x = y;
```

A Variable Declaration starts with the identifier "let", followed by its name. The Value is at the last token of the line (TODO: Needs to be improved)
